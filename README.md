## Note: 
- **Please use iOSExerciseBNI.zip**, some modules is missing because of git submodule reference gone wrong. Due to time constraint I haven't fixed it yet.
- I'm sorry for the messy cocoapods dependency management. To be honest, I'm not familiar with it. I usually use SPM. I hope you could understand.
- for **Unit Test** I only did for **PromoList**. I hope it can be reviewed for my knowledge on unit testing

## Kindly review, Thank you
